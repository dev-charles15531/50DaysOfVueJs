  An interactive comment, reply, and comment-score section<br><br>
 
  This is the 12th project under my [50 projects with vue](https://github.com/dev-charles15531/50ProjectsWithVueJs) learning journey and i'm happy exploring the magic and all sweet things one can do on the web with [vue 3](http://vuejs.org).
  
  This is a solution to the [Interactive comments section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9) by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

<b>üôèüèæYour contributions and critiques are highly welcome here as that would be a means for me to get better.</b>
