# 50 Days Of Vue JS
## Day 7

This contains the complete day 7 project(Mini Auth).
- Install JSON Server on your machine by running the command ```npm install -g json-server```
- Clone the repo and switch to the day 7 branch. 
- On your terminal, cd into the projects directory and run the command: ```npm install```
- Start the JSON Server on port 3001 by running the command ```json-server --watch src/assets/DB/db.json --port 3001```
- Run the command ```npm run dev```

### Note:
- You must have node and npm installed on your computer to run the above commands. So do well to install them if they're not present.
- In the Header component, the right menu isn't reactive in the sense that it dosent show the appropriate menu after login or logout until the component is reloaded. This can be fixed with vuex(i know), but i will update this project and commit when i'm done learning vuex.
- This is the last project i'll develope using the vue 3 options api. From next project, i'll begin building with the composition api :)
