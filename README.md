# 50 Projects With Vue JS
## Project 12

This contains the complete 12th project(interactive comments section).
- Install JSON Server on your machine by running the command ```npm install -g json-server```
- Clone the repo and switch to the day 7 branch. 
- On your terminal, cd into the projects directory and run the command: ```npm install```
- Start the JSON Server on port 3001 by running the command ```json-server --watch data.json --port 3001```
- Run the command ```npm run dev```

### Note:
- You must have node and json-server installed on your computer to run the above commands. So do well to install them if they're not present.
