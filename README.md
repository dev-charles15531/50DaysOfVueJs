# 50 Days Of Vue JS
## Day 9

This contains the complete day 9 project(Auth More).
- Clone the repo and switch to the day 9 branch. 
- On your terminal, cd into the projects directory and run the command: ```npm install```
- Run the command ```npm run dev```

### Note:
- You must have node and npm installed on your computer to run the above commands. So do well to install them if they're not present.
- In the Header component, the right menu isn't reactive in the sense that it dosent show the appropriate menu after login or logout. This can be fixed with vue store(i know), but i will update this project and commit when i'm done learning vuex or pinia.
- You must be connected to the internet to use this app.
- Re-write will be made to this project using the composition API
