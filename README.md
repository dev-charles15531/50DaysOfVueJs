  An iPhone lockscreen UI with mp3 player and more.<br><br>
 
  This is the 13th project under my [50 projects with vue](https://github.com/dev-charles15531/50ProjectsWithVueJs) learning journey and i'm happy exploring the magic and all sweet things one can do on the web with [vue 3](http://vuejs.org).
  Unfortunately, there's a functionality which i am unable to implement, and i believe there's someone out there who can do this and all i am asking for is your contribution (i'll highlight this feature below).

    Your contributions and critiques are highly welcome here as that would be a means for me to get better.

## Features

- Network Connection: It displays a network icon(ios) when connected to the internet, and doesn't when not.
- Battery Feedback: It displays your current battery level in percentage, and also indicates charging and idle state.
- Date Time: It displays your current date and time, displays a moon icon below the date at eve or night, and a sun icon at daytime.
- Mp3 Player: Possesses an mp3 player with seek, navigation and volume control. Six personal musics of mine are available.
- Camera: A camera for snapshot

## Help ðŸ˜¢

The feature i'm still getting difficulties in implementing is:

I would love to read mp3 media tags to get the name of artist, track name, and cover art. I tried using this library: [jsmediatags](https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags) but i still can't get this feature implemented.

Contributions on this would be greatly appreciated, Thanks!
